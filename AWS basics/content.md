## 1-Module 3 


### 1.1-AWS Well-Architected Framwork:

- help u to tackle and prevent common cloud computing challenges 
- it's a set of strategies and guidelines of designing and running workloads in the cloud created by AWS and help to build resilient ,scalable and secure architecture 
- provide an approach for customers to evaluate their architecture 


### 1.2- important of AWS Well-Architected Framework:
- to be ready for sudden challenges of infrastructure or sudden traffic which lead to system crashes and unhappy customers and bad reputation.
### 1.3- Pillars of the Framework:
- **security** : focuses on protection of your data ,systems and assets and ensure confidentiality of data , identity and access management and controls to detecting security threads 
- **cost-optimizations** : avoiding unnecessary costs , using right types of resources , making cost-effective decisions over long term
- **performance-efficiency** : using computing resources efficiently ,  maintaining the efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- **sustainability**: minimizing environmental impact of running clouds workloads   
--------- most important two pillars --------------
- **reliability**:
- **operational excellence** : running  and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuity. to make sure we have a system which not just efficient and reliable but also improves over time.
#### design principles for operational excellence :
- **perform operations as code** : by thinking of your entire workload as a piece of software and by abstract operations into script and make those scripts automatable to reduce human mistakes .
- **make frequent , small and reversible changes** : by making changes in small steps that can be undone if needed which help u to deal with issues quickly and do not affect on ur customers 
-  **refine operational procedures frequently**: as a workloads evolves your procedures should evolves also . and also to be always on lookout for ways to refine and streamline your operations. 
- **Anticipate Failure**: by identifying failures before they occurs , regularly testing theses scenarios to ensure every thing is up to date . 
- **Learn From Operational Failures**: consider every failure is a learning opportunity and use them as motivation to be stronger .
