- Amazon EC2 offers¬†**various purchasing options to suit different workload requirements and budgetary considerations.**
    1. On-Demand Instances
    2. Reserved Instances
    3. Savings Plans
    4. Spot Instances
    5. Dedicated Hosts
    6. Dedicated Instances
    7. Capacity Reservations

### **EC2 Purchasing Options - On-Demand Instances**

- **Pay-as-you-go model with no long-term commitments.**
- Ideal for applications with unpredictable workloads or short-term projects.
- Offers¬†**flexibility to start and stop instances as needed without upfront payments or long-term contracts.**
- **Use cases:**
    - **Variable Workloads:**¬†Ideal for unpredictable usage patterns or fluctuating workloads.
    - **Development and Testing:**¬†Well-suited for temporary environments without long-term commitments.
    - **Short-Term Projects:**¬†Quickly provision instances for short-term initiatives or projects.

### **EC2 Purchasing Options - Reserved Instances**

- Reserved capacity for¬†**a specific instance type in a selected region.**
    - **72% discount compared to on-demand**
    - You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Options for¬†**1-year or 3-year terms**.
- Suitable for applications with¬†**steady-state workloads or predictable usage patterns.**
- **Use cases:**
    - Ideal for applications with steady-state usage patterns.
    - **Capacity Planning:**¬†Enables organizations to secure reserved capacity in advance for anticipated workloads, ensuring resource availability when needed.

### **EC2 Purchasing Options - Savings Plans**

- Flexible pricing model offering savings on compute usage across EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, and Fargate.
    - Provides significant discounts compared to On-Demand rates, with¬†**the flexibility to choose between different commitment options.**
- Ideal for¬†**workloads with consistent usage or those requiring flexibility in instance types and sizes.**

### EC2 Purchasing Options - Spot Instances

- Bid on unused EC2 capacity, allowing access to spare compute capacity at reduced rates.
- Offers the potential for¬†**significant cost savings,**¬†sometimes up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices.
- Suitable for¬†**fault-tolerant applications, batch processing, or workloads with flexible start and end times.**
- **Use cases:**
