## **Buckets in S3**

- Amazon S3 facilitates the **storage of objects (files) within "buckets" (directories):**
    - Bucket names must be globally unique across all regions and accounts.
    - Buckets are established at the regional level.

    - Length between 3 and 63 characters.
    - Not in the format of an IP address.
    - Commencing with a lowercase letter or number.

- **JSON**
    - Buckets and objects
    - Permit or Restrict
    - APIs permitted or restricted
    - User or account affected by the policy

    - Enable public access to the bucket
