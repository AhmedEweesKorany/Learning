# Algorithms
## What is Algorithm?
- Algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem.

## Charaacteristics of Algorithm
- Input
- Output
- Finiteness
- Definiteness
- Effectiveness

### Input
- Input is the information that is supplied to the algorithm for processing.
- Algorithm can have zero or more inputs.
### Output
- Output is the information that is produced by the algorithm.
- Algorithm should have at least 1 output.
### Finiteness
- A finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem.
- Algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps.
### Definiteness
- Each step in the algorithm must be clear and unambiguous.
### Effectiveness
- Each step in the algorithm must be carried out effectively.
- You shouldn't write unneccessary steps.
- What ever steps you write, it should do something in the procedure.
